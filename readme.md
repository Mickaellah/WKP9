# WKP9

## Work that I did in this poject.

1. I created a file for HTML, and added some elements in it, such as header of the whole page and a div to put the data in.

1. I created a script file for all of javascript. I grabbed the div which I have created in the html page and then created an async function to fetch the data from the url that has given it the instruction. 

1. I created an async function again and created the html to get all of the data working in the html page, and when that is done I sort the rt_score in the first function that I have created.
